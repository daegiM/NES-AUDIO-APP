# NES-AUDIO-APP 

## This is an audio app for NES 

I created sound data via famistudio 

Famistudio exported to NES rom 

I disassembled the rom and the result is ASM code 

You can assmeble the code using ASM6 

On CMD type 

|| asm6 ddd.asm ddd.nes 

Then it will create ddd NES rom file 

You can run the rom file with NES emulator
